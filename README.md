## installation

Install the basic javascript vite SolidJS template via node:
https://github.com/solidjs/templates

Afterwards, just replace the `src` folder in the template with the `src` folder in this repo.

Finally, run:
`npm install`

And you're good to go.

`npm run dev` to run a development server.
