i saw someone make a terminal style website on youtube so i also wanted to make one, as well as put my new SolidJS skills to the test

so yeah, enjoy, you can visit the website hosted on github pages here!

i don't really have anything else to say lol, other than it took me about 30 commits to properly upload the project to this repo skull

##source download & installation
1) clone the repo

2) cd into source

3) run npm install

4) done, run development server with npm run dev
