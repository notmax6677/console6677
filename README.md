so yeah, enjoy, you can visit the website [hosted on github pages here.](https://notmax6677.github.io/console6677/)

i don't really have anything else to say lol, other than it took me about 30 (now 40) commits to properly upload the project to this repo for the first time ðŸ’€

## source download & installation
1) clone the repo

2) cd into source

3) run npm install

4) done, run development server with npm run dev
