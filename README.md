# console6677
i saw someone make a terminal style website on youtube so i also wanted to make one, as well as put my new SolidJS skills to the test

so yeah, enjoy, you can visit the [website hosted on github pages here!](https://notmax6677.github.io/console6677/)

i don't really have anything else to say lol, other than it took me about 30 commits to properly upload the project to this repo ðŸ’€

## source download & installation

1) clone the repo

2) cd into source

3) run `npm install`

4) done, run development server with `npm run dev`
